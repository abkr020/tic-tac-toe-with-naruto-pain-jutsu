# my idea is

my idea is to create a normal tic tac toe game and when the game ends i want to show a pop up whth a message **do not click the the tiddle key (~) it will activate the pain's jutsu i.e. gravitational pull** and if user clicks the the **~** button the 7 new blocks will comes out of the windown and get attached to the existion board of 3 X 3 making it 4 X 4. _and if user press the combine keys the **all mighty push** jutsu will activate removing these 7 blocks out of the window_



**shift + key below the escape key**
